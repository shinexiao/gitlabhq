## Enabling build emails

To receive e-mail notifications about the result status of your builds, visit
your project's **Settings > Services > Builds emails** and activate the service.

In the _Recipients_ area, provide a list of e-mails separated by comma.

Check the _Add pusher_ checkbox if you want the committer to also receive
e-mail notifications about each build's status.

If you enable the _Notify only broken builds_ option, e-mail notifications will
be sent only for failed builds.
