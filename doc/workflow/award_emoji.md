# Award emoji

>**Note:**
[Introduced][1825] in GitLab 8.2.

When you're collaborating online, you get fewer opportunities for high-fives
and thumbs-ups. Emoji can be awarded to issues and merge requests, making
virtual celebrations easier.

Award emoji make it much easier to give and receive feedback without a long
comment thread. Comments that are only emoji will automatically become
award emoji.

## Sort issues and merge requests on vote count

>**Note:**
[Introduced][2871] in GitLab 8.5.

You can quickly sort issues and merge requests by the number of votes they
have received. The sort options can be found in the dropdown menu as "Most
popular" and "Least popular".

The total number of votes is not summed up. An issue with 18 upvotes and 5
downvotes is considered more popular than an issue with 17 upvotes and no
downvotes.
